                                Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of cyber attack where a malicious actor
                                tricks a user into unknowingly performing an action on a web application. The attack takes
                                advantage of the trust relationship between the user and the web application. When a user
                                is logged in to a web application, the application may store cookies or other information
                                on the user's computer, which the attacker can use to make fraudulent requests on the
                                user's behalf. CSRF attacks can be prevented by implementing measures such as anti-CSRF
                                tokens.

                                attack, an attacker may use a variety of techniques to inject malicious code into a web

                                or deface websites. To prevent XSS attacks, web developers can implement measures such as
                                input validation, output encoding, and the use of Content Security Policy (CSP).
